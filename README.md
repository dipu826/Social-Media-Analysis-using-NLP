# Tesla, Tweets and Market Whirlwinds ⚡
Understanding How Elon Musk’s Tweets Influence Markets and Public Sentiment

# 📂 What it does

  - Sentiment Analysis: Measures positive, negative, and neutral reactions to Musk’s tweets and public actions using Reddit and YouTube data.
  - Topic Modeling: Identifies trending themes related to Tesla, SpaceX, and Twitter using LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation).
  - Network Analysis: Builds social graphs to detect communities, influential authors, and co-occurring keywords.
  - Stock Correlation: Compares Tesla’s stock trends with public sentiment and major tweet events.

# ⚙️ How it runs

  - Data collected via Reddit API (PRAW) and YouTube API.
  - Text processing, tokenization, and cleaning done with NLTK.
  - VADER used for sentiment scoring; LDA (scikit-learn + pyLDAvis) for topic modeling.
  - NetworkX applied for community detection, egonets, and co-occurrence graph visualization.
  - Analysis and plots created in Python (Jupyter Notebook).

# 🛠️ Tech Used

  - Python
  - Reddit API & YouTube API
  - NLTK & VADER
  - Scikit-learn & PyLDAVis
  - NetworkX & Matplotlib
